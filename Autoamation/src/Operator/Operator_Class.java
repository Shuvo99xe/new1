		//Operator: Operator in JAVA is a symbol that is used to perform operations and are used to perform operations on variables and values.
		//Variable: Variable are containers for storing data. It can be used as a container which holds value for you. In Java all the variable has to be declared first before execution. Every variable is assigned a data type.
		//Variable can be created assigning a value. Or can be created without assigning a value in to it.

		System.out.println("a + b = " + (a+b));
		
		//Subtraction operator
		System.out.println("a - b = " + (a-b));
		
		//Multiplication operator
